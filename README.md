# Traffic-Light-Controller-using-Verilog-
This project implements a real-world Traffic Light Controller based on Indian road conditions using Verilog HDL and Vivado 2019.1. The design uses a finite state machine (FSM) to control North–South, East–West, and pedestrian lights in a realistic timing sequence.
